Time was the largest challenge this increment. Being at the end of the semester, we all had final assignments and exams from other classes to focus our timr on. Fortunately, this was the first increment where the systems that we were working on were no dependent on each other allowing us to work asynchronously. We decided to lower the scope away from having multiple enemies and instead focus on improving what we already had. Jake focused on level design and enemy AI. Chris focused on player abilities such as adding camera lock. Dion focused on the inventory system.

## 7. Stakeholder Communication
<!-- Draft an email communication to the stakeholders of the project succinctly communicating progress and current project status. The email should be intended for a non-technical audience that is expertly aware of the domain your application is designed for. You may not “break the fourth wall” or otherwise refer to the course in the email, instead, you should think about how setbacks or issues you encounter may reflect setbacks that happen in the larger context of production software development and explain them as such. The email should not exceed 500 words. -->
Dear Stakeholders,

We have created a compelling virtual slice, nearing the full functionality of our product. We have faced some delays, which is to be expected in the industry and due to the scope of our game, but we are progressing at a good pace with those factors in mind. We have tightened up the combat system with important gameplay features like camera targeting, and improved our inventory menu system. We have made strides on level development, and on the complexity of our enemy behavior. 

Thank you for your support,
Echoes of Babylon Team
