## 3. Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!-- Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed. -->

- Created a level 
- Implemented enemies detecting player by sight
- Implemented a camera lock on system, allowing the player to lock the camera on to an enemy

## 4. Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this incrmeent
<!-- Please describe here in detail: 

- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges 

- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes.  

- anything that went wrong during this increment -->

The main challenge during this increment was scheduling. We were at a point in the project where many systems relied on systems that other group members were working on, and we struggled to schedule time to work together. We resolved this by setting aside time later during the increment to work together and catch up. As a result of this problem our scope had to shrink slightly. We decided that a full level was more appropriate for the third increment, as the software development aspect of the project needed more attention. We also decided that the ranged weapon feature could be delayed, as it requires the also delayed camera and targeting features. The camera proved more problematic than anticipated due to some challenges in the engine of determining the locations of enemies relative to the player, and had to be delayed after realizing the time budgeted for the feature was not sufficient.


Time was a major challenge during this increment, especially due to the time required for different assignemnts. 

## 5. Team Member Contribution for this increment

## 7. Stakeholder Communication
<!-- Draft an email communication to the stakeholders of the project succinctly communicating progress and current project status. The email should be intended for a non-technical audience that is expertly aware of the domain your application is designed for. You may not “break the fourth wall” or otherwise refer to the course in the email, instead, you should think about how setbacks or issues you encounter may reflect setbacks that happen in the larger context of production software development and explain them as such. The email should not exceed 500 words. -->
Dear Stakeholders,

We have created a compelling virutal slice, nearing the full functionality of our product. We have faced some delays, which is to be expected in the industry and due to the scope of our game, but we are progressing at a good pace with those factors in mind. We have tightened up the combat system with important gameplay features like camera targeting, and improved our inventory menu system. We have made strides on level development, and on the complezity of our enemy behavior. 

Thank you for your support,
Echoes of Babylon Team
