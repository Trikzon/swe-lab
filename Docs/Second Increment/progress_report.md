# Progress Report
- Increment 1
- Group #30

## 1. Team Members
- Dion Tryban (dmt22c)
- Jake Younan (jjy22)
- Chris Swezy (cls20f)

## 2. Project Title and Description
Echoes of Babylon

Echoes of Babylon is a mech action game inspired by the souls-like genre and 3D beat-em ups. Our final product will be a single level demo with a fleshed out combat system with multiple enemy types.

## 3. Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!-- Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed. -->

- Created an inventory system
- Created an inheritance based equipment system
- Used the GAS plugin to change the player's attributes based on equipment
- Created an equation based damage system shared by both the player and enemies to replace the original placeholder system
- Implemented the enemy attacking behavior, allowing the player to be killed
- Created the block mechanic

## 4. Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this incrmeent
<!-- Please describe here in detail: 

- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges 

- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes.  

- anything that went wrong during this increment -->

The main challenge during this increment was scheduling. We were at a point in the project where many systems relied on systems that other group members were working on, and we struggled to schedule time to work together. 
We resolved this by setting aside time later during the increment to work together and catch up. As a result of this problem our scope had to shrink slightly. We decided that a full level was more appropriate for the third increment, 
as the software development aspect of the project needed to take precedence. We also decided that the ranged weapon feature could be delayed, as it requires the also delayed camera and targeting features. The camera proved more problematic 
than anticipated due to some challenges in th engine of determining the locations of enemies relative to the player, and had to be delayed after realizing the time budgeted for the feature was not sufficient. 

## 5. Team Member Contribution for this increment
<!-- Please list each individual member and their contributions to each of the deliverables in this increment (be as detailed as possible). In other words, describe the contribution of each team member to: 

    the progress report, including the sections they wrote or contributed to 

    the requirements and design document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to 

    the implementation and testing document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to 

    the source code (be detailed about which parts of the system each team member contributed to and how)

## 6. Plans for the next increment
<!-- If this report if for the first or second increment, describe what are you planning to achieve in the next increment. -->
Next incrment, we are planning to further implement the idea of multiple weapons. We currently have the systems in place to switch items and have multiple placeholder weapons, but we need to create final versions of different weapons, and implement more robust combat mechanics to make them more unique using different animations and collisions. We also plan to add ranged weapons and more enemies including a boss. We plan to add a final version of a level for the player to explore. 

## 7. Stakeholder Communication
<!-- Draft an email communication to the stakeholders of the project succinctly communicating progress and current project status. The email should be intended for a non-technical audience that is expertly aware of the domain your application is designed for. You may not “break the fourth wall” or otherwise refer to the course in the email, instead, you should think about how setbacks or issues you encounter may reflect setbacks that happen in the larger context of production software development and explain them as such. The email should not exceed 500 words. -->
Dear Stakeholders,

Our project is progressing at a reasonable rate, although we are experiencing slight delays. Training our team to use the Unreal Engine has used more of the initial time for our first deadline than we anticipated, but that time will be well spent to ensure a quality project and speedy development later on. We have designed the core systems of game, and laid out a thorough, robust architecture for the software design that will allow us to move quickly as we progress out of training.

Currently, we have our player character with basic abilities and a base enemy that we can easily expand into multiple enemy types. We are about to be finished implementing our system for weapons and attacking after overcoming a delay with Unreal's Gameplay Ability System.

Thank you for your support,
Echoes of Babylon Team
